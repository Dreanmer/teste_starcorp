# Business Class FizzBuzz Test

This is the common Fizz Buzz test, but made with S.O.L.I.D principles.

### Setup

- run `composer install`
- point your server to `public/index.php`

### Tests

`composer test`

## Bonus

As an company challenged me to do this test with only one if, with no else or decision branchs, i made this two scripts:

- FizzBuzz single if (regex) solution -> [gist](https://gist.github.com/dreanmer/e49faca778a2cc0efc21fa2d688b6f80)
- FizzBuzz no if (range) solution -> [gist](https://gist.github.com/dreanmer/9ce8f70b6312a799516e2e6939867f35)
